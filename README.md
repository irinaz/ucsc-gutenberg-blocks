### Basic Block Development

As a reference a commit to adding a demo block to this repo can be found here: https://github.com/ucsc/ucsc-gutenberg-blocks/commit/10dafbecede6286ae2ad2868b58e61d90443dc08

This commit show's how to create a Dynamic Block vs a Static block. There are many benefits to using Dynamic Blocks, here are some resources discussing the benefits:

- https://design.oit.ncsu.edu/2019/03/11/choosing-dynamic-blocks-one/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EtQO1kx8Vg

#### Instructions:

- Create a file in the `classes/` to hold the PHP/Wordpress code.
  - Actions can be added
  - Blocks can be registered
  - Site and Network settings
- Include the new file in the `index.php` file and instantiate the class
- Create a js file in `src/blocks/` directory
  - This file can import libs and components but is not a component itself
  - Create and export a function where you can register the block.
  - Make sure the name you are registering here matches the name you registered in PHP
- In `src/index.js` import your function and call it so that the block gets registered.

### How To Contribute

- Create Feature branch `git checkout -b "feature/site-level-admin-form"`
- Write code
- Check `git diff` to see files that have been modified.
- Git add the files you have modified or added: `git add <filename> <filename> <filename>` or use `git add .` if all the modified files need to be checked in
- Commit with a good message `git commit -m "feat: âœ¨ Updating README"`
- push code to github: `git push origin feature/site-level-admin-form`
- In GitHub create a PR into the main branch
